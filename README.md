# Project Background
The first assignment was to deal with deadlocks and resolve the race conditions issue.
 
The second assignment was mainly to set up the socket server to handle clients' requests and even cope with multithread problems by using pthread.

> (Made mistake that did not separate sufficient files to hold the functions)
